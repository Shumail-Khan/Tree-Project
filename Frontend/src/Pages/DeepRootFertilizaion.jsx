                From food and materials to symbols of strength, protection, and stability - trees are a powerful gift from nature that bring beauty and shade to our landscapes. However, like all living things they need the proper nutrients to stay healthy with vivid foliage; which is why we must take care of them.

              What is Deep Root Fertilization

              <p>
                Deep root fertilization is a type of tree care that helps promote
                robust and healthy trees and shrubs. It involves applying
                fertilizer to the roots of plants, either through injection into
                the soil or directly onto their roots. This service provides
                essential nutrients and aerates the soil, making it easier for
                trees to absorb them.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-10">
                Deep root fertilization can help make trees and shrubs more
                resistant to diseases and insect infestations. It also helps
                promote healthy root growth, enabling trees to access the
                essential minerals they need for growth and vitality. With deep
                root fertilization, you can ensure that your trees and shrubs will
                stay strong and vibrant.

                Difference Between Deep Root Fertilization and Surface Fertilization
              </h3>

              <p>
                Surface fertilization is the traditional way of applying
                fertilizer to trees. It involves spreading a slow-release granular
                fertilizer around the base of the tree or shrub, usually in late
                winter or early fall. While this method can help provide essential
                nutrients for your small plants and grass, it does not guarantee
                that the fertilizer will reach its roots.
              </p>

              </div>

              <p className="mt-4">
                In contrast, deep root fertilization is a specifically designed
                technique for increasing the nutrient uptake of trees. It involves
                injecting liquid or granular fertilizer into the soil and directly
                onto the roots. This process ensures that nutrients are delivered
                where it matters most - at their source - so your trees can get
                all the nutrients they need.
              </p>

              <p>
                Moreover, while it is possible to carry out a conventional
                fertilizing job without professional help, deep root fertilization
                requires an Arborist due to its intricate equipment and
                specialized techniques.

                At Ken's Tree Service, our experienced Arborists use specialized equipment to safely and effectively deliver the fertilizer directly onto the roots of your trees. First, they will assess the condition of the soil and determine what type and amount of fertilizer are needed for optimal results.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nutrient content, environmental conditions, and tree species are all taken into consideration when formulating a fertilizer mix. Our team will also take into account any insect or disease issues that may be present to provide the best possible solution for your trees.
              </p>
              <p>
                The arborist then injects liquid fertilizer into holes that have been drilled into the soil. Depending on your needs, granular fertilizer can also be applied directly to the tree's root system. The entire process is designed to maximize nutrient absorption and help keep your trees looking their best.
